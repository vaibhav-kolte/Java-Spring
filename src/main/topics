Introduction to Annotation
    Annotation in Java provide a way to add metadata in your code
    Example
        @Component
        @Autowired
        @Qualifier
        @Value
        @Repository
        @Service
        @Controller
        @RequestMapping
        @SpringBootApplication

Understanding Components and ComponentScan
    Component refer to a Java class that is mapped by the Spring IoC Container

    Defining Components in Spring
        Using XML
        Using Annotations

    Using XML
        <bean id="myComponent" class="com.example.MyComponent"/>

    Using Annotation
        @Component
        public class MyComponent{
            // Class implementation
        }

    Component Scanning is a feature helps to automatically detect and register bean from predefined packed paths.

    <!-- Enable component scanning -->
    <context:component-scan base-package="car.example.componentscan"/>

Introduction to Spring Boot
    Introduction to Spring Boot
        Open-source, Java based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.

    Spring-> Lots of steps involved in setting up, configuration, writing boilerplate code, deployment of the app.
    Spring Boot-> Offers a set of pre-configured components or defaults, and eliminating the need for a lot of boilerplate code that was involved in setting up a Spring application.

    Spring boot = Spring framework + Prebuild configuration + Embedded server

Component of Spring Boot
    -> Spring Boot Starters
    -> Auto Configuration
    -> Spring Boot Actuator
    -> Embedded Server
    -> Spring Boot DevTools

Advantages of Spring Boot
    -> Stand alone and Quick Start
    -> Starter code
    -> Less configuration
    -> Reduces cost and application development time

Why do developers love Spring Boot?
    -> Java based
    -> Fast, easy
    -> Comes with embedded server
    -> Various plugins
    -> Avoids boilerplate code and configurations

How does Spring Boot works? Architecture

Following are the different tiers
    ->Presentation layer
    -> Service layer
    -> Data access layer

Presentation layer
    Presentation layer presents the data the application features to the user. This is the layer where in all the controller classes exist.

Service layer
    Service layer is where business logic resides in the application. Task such as evaluation, decision making, processing of data is done at this layer.

Data Access layer
    Data access layer is the layer where all the repository classes reside.
